# spaces are so critical in python, you cannot put any extra space 

# data types in python 

# integer  = all the numbers from negative to positive side 
# float = all the  numbers with decimal points 
# double =  very big decimal point number  
# string = group of characters(alphabets, numbers, symbols, spaces )
# bool = True/False 
# char = 'a' '0', '-', ':', '(' = single characters are stored in char  

# variable = it is a container to store something in the memory 

# integers
# num = 45 
# print(num)

# ************** variable naming conventions ********** (how you can make a variable)
# 1.you can write any alphabet including lowercase and uppercase in the variable 
# example: num, number, string, megan, urvashi, URVASHI 
# 2. Numbers can be added in a variable but not at the first place 
# example: megan45, go4578tu, 
# 45tyu --> this is wrong 
# 3. Symbols are not allowed in the variable except _( underscore )
# example: num_, _num, n_um 
# 4. spaces are not allowed in the variable 
# example: nu m --> this is wrong 

# m = "Megan"
# print(m)

# M = "Megan"
# print(M)

# Number = 34 
# print(Number)

# m23 = "Megan"
# print(m23)

# m45M = "Megan"
# print(m45M)

# 45m = "Megan"
# print(45m)

# number% = 34 
# print(number%)

# number^ = 56 
# print(number^)

# num^ber = 4 
# print(num^ber)

# ^number = 6 
# print(^number)

# number$ = 5 
# print(number$)

# number_ = 23 
# print(number_)

# _number = 4 
# print(_number)

# num_ber = 5 
# print(num_ber)

# num ber = 45 
# print(num ber)

# num = 34 
# print(type(num))
# print(num)

# num = float(num)
# print(num)
# print(type(num))

# num = 4.5 
# print(type(num))

# we cannot convert a string containing alphabets into an integer 
# we can convert a string containing only numbers into an integer 

# name = "Megan"
# print(type(name))
# print(name)

# name = int(name)
# print(type(name))

# case-sensitivity = lowercase and uppercase are different names 

# name = "Megan"

# Name = "Megan"

# NAME = "Megan"

# nAme = "Megan"

# a = 1 
# b = 2 
# c = 4 

# we can assign values to multiple variables in a single line like this: 
# a, b, c = 1, 2, 4 

# print(a)
# print(b)
# print(c)

# a = b = c = 1 
# print(a)
# print(b)
# print(c)

# we can print multiple variables in single line using commas(,)
# a = 3 
# b = 4 
# c = 7

# print(a, b, c)

# a = 3 
# b = 4 
# c = 7

# print(a + b + c)


# num = 34 
# name = "Megan"

# it will give error
# we cannot add a string with a number 
# print(num + name)

# print(name + num)

# strings 

# mystr = "Megan"
# print(mystr[2])

# print(mystr[1])

# print(mystr[0])

# mystr = "I am having a big task"
